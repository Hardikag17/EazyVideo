## SUBSCRIPTION VIA NFT’S

## About the project:-

The project facilitates the user to buy or rent subscriptions of several online streaming platform (OTT’s) under one roof via NFT’s for a custom amount of time.

Buy: Buy the OTT service directly from a service provider.

Rent: While the user is not using his/her subscription package, user can lend it to other users willing to rent/watch by sharing the time bounded decaying nft. This way user can make extensive use of the membership and also monetize on it if user is not using it personally by renting it on the platform.

Adding the OTT service: To add your OTT service organization can verify few checks using their social profiles and register their service for user’s to buy.

## Problem statement

Usually whenever we take subscription from any OTT platform we often use it only 5-10% of time we subscribe for, but we ends up paying for the whole lot amount of time, this is where our platform XYZ comes.

## Our Solution

Using XYZ platform anyone can rent out their OTT subscriptions while they are not using it and monetize on it. User can take subscriptions for whatever time they like by making customised plans. All of this would be done by using decaying NFTs

## Snips

- Users get an option to renew the same NFT with an amount which is less then buying a new one. They get this pop-up a day before expiration.
