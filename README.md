## Problem statement

Usually whenever we take subscription from any OTT platform we often use it only 5-10% of time we subscribe for, but we ends up paying for the whole lot amount of time, this is where our platform XYZ comes.

## Our Solution

Using XYZ platform anyone can rent out their OTT subscriptions while they are not using it and monetize on it. User can take subscriptions for whatever time they like by making customised plans. All of this would be done by using decaying NFTs

# ü§î Why NFTs?

‚úîÔ∏è NFT based subscription makes it easy for service providers to vaildate the user identity, otherwise users keep sharing their passwords with thier friends and family.

‚úîÔ∏è While the user is not using his/her subscription package, user can lend it to other users willing to rent/watch by sharing the time bounded decaying nft. This way user can make extensive use of the membership and also monetize on it if user is not using it personally by renting it on the platform.

## üíª Track we have worked on

_NFT, Art & Gaming_

## üíª Bouties we have worked on

_IPFS Filecoin Bounty:_ User's OTT services NFT is being uploaded on IPFS network

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Services provided by the project

**Buy:** Buy the OTT service directly from a service provider.

**Rent:** Rent the user's services for `x` amount of day by paying the `price per day` in matic tokens

**Adding the OTT service:** To add your OTT service organization can verify few checks using their social profiles and register their service for user‚Äôs to buy.

## Snips

## Future Aspects

- Users get an option to renew the same NFT with an amount which is less then buying a new one. They get this pop-up a day before expiration.
